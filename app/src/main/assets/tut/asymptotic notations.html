    <p>Following are the commonly used asymptotic notations to calculate the running time complexity of an algorithm.</p>
    <ul style="list-style: square;">
        <li>O Notation</li>
        <li>&#8486; Notation</li>
        <li>&#920; Notation</li>
    </ul>   
    
    <p><b>Big Oh Notation, O</b> &minus; The notation O(n) is the formal way to express the upper bound of an algorithm's running time. It measures the worst case time complexity or the longest amount of time an algorithm can possibly take to complete.</p> 
    <p><b>Omega Notation, &#8486;</b> &minus; The notation &#8486;(n) is the formal way to express the lower bound of an algorithm's running time. It measures the best case time complexity or the best amount of time an algorithm can possibly take to complete.</p>
    <p><b>Theta Notation, &#920;</b> &minus; The notation &#920;(n) is the formal way to express both the lower bound and the upper bound of an algorithm's running time.</p>
