        <p>Efficiency of an algorithm can be analyzed at two different stages, before implementation and after implementation. They are the following &minus;</p>

      <ul>
          <li><b>A Priori Analysis</b> &minus; This is a theoretical analysis of an algorithm. Efficiency of an algorithm is measured by assuming that all other factors, for example, processor speed, are constant and have no effect on the implementation.</li>
          <li><b>A Posteriori Analysis</b> &minus; This is an empirical analysis of an algorithm. The selected algorithm is implemented using programming language. This is then executed on target computer machine. In this analysis, actual statistics like running time and space required, are collected.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We shall learn about a priori algorithm analysis. Algorithm analysis deals with the execution or running time of various operations involved. The running time of an operation can be defined as the number of computer instructions executed per operation.</p>
