<p class="meme">Data Structure is a systematic way to organize data in order to use it efficiently. Following terms are the foundation terms of a data structure.</p>

<div class="meme">
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
 <li><b>Interface</b> &minus; Each data structure has an interface. Interface represents the set of operations that a data structure supports. An interface only provides the list of supported operations, type of parameters they can accept and return type of these operations. </li>
  <li><b>Implementation</b> &minus; Implementation provides the internal representation of a data structure. Implementation also provides the definition of the algorithms used in the operations of the data structure.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="meme">
<h3>Characteristics of a Data Structure</h3>
 <ul style="list-style: square;">
   <li><b>Correctness</b> &minus; Data structure implementation should implement its interface correctly.</li>
   <li><b>Time Complexity</b> &minus; Running time or the execution time of operations of data structure must be as small as possible.</li>
   <li><b>Space Complexity</b> &minus; Memory usage of a data structure operation should be as little as possible.</li>
 </ul>
</div>
<div class="meme">
  <h3>Need for Data Structure</h3>
  <p>As applications are getting complex and data rich, there are three common problems that applications face now&minus;a&minus;days.</p>
  <ul style="list-style: square;">
    <li><b>Data Search</b> &minus; Consider an inventory of 1 million items of a store. If the application is to search an item, it has to search an item in 1 million items every time slowing down the search. As data grows, search will become slower.</li>
    <li><b>Processor Speed</b> &minus; Processor speed although being very high, falls limited if the data grows to billion records.</li>
    <li><b>Multiple Requests</b> &minus; As thousands of users can search data simultaneously on a web server, even the fast server fails while searching the data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To solve the above-mentioned problems, data structures come to rescue. Data can be organized in a data structure in such a way that all items may not be required to be searched, and the required data can be searched almost instantly.</p>
