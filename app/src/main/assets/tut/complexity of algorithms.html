    <p> The complexity of algorithms is the amount of time, storage and/or other resources necessary to execute them. Usually, this involves determining a function that relates the length of an algorithm's input to the number of steps it takes (its time complexity) or the number of storage locations it uses (its space complexity).</p>

    <ul style="list-style: square;">
        <li><b>Time Complexity</b> &minus; Time complexity of an algorithm represents the amount of time required by the algorithm to run to completion. Time requirements can be defined as a numerical function T(n), where T(n) can be measured as the number of steps, provided each step consumes constant time. For example, addition of two n-bit integers takes n steps. Consequently, the total computational time is T(n) = c*n, where c is the time taken for the addition of two bits. Here, we observe that T(n) grows linearly as the input size increases.</li>
        <li><p><b>Space Complexity</b> &minus; Space complexity of an algorithm represents the amount of memory space required by the algorithm in its life cycle. The space required by an algorithm is equal to the sum of the following two components &minus;</p>
        <ul style="list-style: square;">
            <li>A fixed part that is a space required to store certain data and variables, that are independent of the size of the problem. For example, simple variables and constants used, program size, etc. </li>
            <li>A variable part is a space required by variables, whose size depends on the size of the problem. For example, dynamic memory allocation, recursion stack space, etc. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Asymptotic Analysis</b> &minus; Asymptotic analysis of an algorithm refers to defining the mathematical boundation/framing of its run-time performance.
        Using asymptotic analysis, we can very well conclude the best case, average case, and worst case scenario of an algorithm.
        Asymptotic analysis is input bound i.e., if there's no input to the algorithm, it is concluded to work in a constant time.
        Other than the "input" all other factors are considered constant  </p>
    <p>Usually, the time required by an algorithm falls under three types &minus; </p>
    <ul style="list-style: square;">
        <li><b>Best Case</b> &minus; Minimum time required for program execution.</li>
        <li><b>Average Case</b> &minus; Average time required for program execution.</li>
        <li><b>Worst Case</b> &minus; Maximum time required for program execution.</li>
    </ul>
